R2.5.1              26-Jan-2021 Kukhee Kim
                    - fix epics version check macro to support epics 7 and higher
                      (to avoid undefined device entries in epics 7)

R2.5.0:		    17-Aug-2020 Hugo Slepicka
		    - Modified to build with EPICS 7.

R2.4.0:             07-Mar-2018 Marcio P. Donadio
                    - Modified to build for git workflow and EPICS 3.15.

EDT_CL-R2-3-3:	    Added 'field(PINI,"YES")' to PV from camera13921040.db

EDT_CL-R2-3-2:	    Added several PVs to monitor DAQ

EDT_CL-R2-3-1:	    Addition of PV for controlling the name
	            of the image saved by the IP900CL-12B camera
	            during a DAQ. Added addresses for 2 more NAS servers.
		    TODO: make addresses configurable (PVs)

EDT_CL-R2-3-0:      Major changes to the IP900CL-12B camera support
		    Added option start data acquisition of images
	            and save them to a given directory when
	            finished. A sequencer disables the camera trigger
		    while files are being saved.
		    The image buffer is now per IOC, not per camera,
		    which means only one camera can perform a DAQ.
		    A DAQ is triggered by an EVR event (default to
	  	    event 16 - 0.5Hz).

EDT_CL-R2-2-2:      Modified release file to follow eco.
                    needed to define macros for min() and max()
                    as these were removed from EPICS BASE R3-14-11 and
                    higher. 
      
EDT_CL-R2-2-1:      Reduce ring buffer size of PTM4200 from 10 to 5 to save memory

EDT_CL-R2-2-0:     Build with base-R3-14-8-2-lcls6
                   Build with rtems-4.9.4

EDT_CL-R2-1-1:     Build with base-R3-14-8-2-lcls5
                   Build with rtems-4.9.3

EDT_CL-R2-0-1      Add SMOO record for laser PTM6710CL centroid to lock
                   Build with rtems-4.9.1 and base-r3-14-8-2-lcls3

EDT_CL-R2-0-0      Build with rtems-4.9.1 and base-r3-14-8-2-lcls3

TODO:             Change p2pthreshold/pixel to float value and give more explanation
                  Add minimal number of pixel noise
                  Add timestamp event ID record
                  Add I/O Intr for waveform record

                  For PTM6710CL, remove the noise ratio default to allow restore

                  Change default timing event ID to 159 for timestamp
                  Support PMC DV Fox. EDT_PMC_DV_FOX=1 has to be set in st.cmd to use fiber PMC card.
                  Otherwise PMC DV C-Link will be assumed. Current mixing PMC DV Fox and C-Link is one IOC is not supported.

EDT_CL-R1-3-8:    For PTM6710CL, remove p2pthreshold/pixel default value to allow restore
                  For PTM6710CL, does not remove noise level from whole wf just to portion below noise level
